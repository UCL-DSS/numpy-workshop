It provides `ndarray`, a homogeneous n-dimensional array object, with methods to efficiently operate on it. NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of **mathematical operations on arrays**. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee **efficient calculations** with **arrays and matrices** and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.\n",
